# My Rust Journey

It all began as a late-night remedy for boredom during the study holidays of my 4th semester. It was 1 AM, and I found myself itching to explore something new. I stumbled upon Rust while going through slides for one of my Embedded Systems courses, and it piqued my curiosity.

So, I decided to dive into Rust programming, not knowing where it would lead. Little did I know that it would turn into something more exciting! During those study breaks, I started exploring Rust, and gradually, I found myself implementing machine learning algorithms.

- **Linear Regression**:
  Implemented a simple linear regression algorithm to predict outcomes based on input features.

- **Logistic Regression**:
  Developed logistic regression for binary classification tasks, inspired by real-world applications.

- **Decision Trees**:
  Explored decision tree algorithms for both classification and regression tasks, understanding their inner workings.

- **K-means Clustering**:
  Implemented K-means clustering algorithm for unsupervised learning tasks, clustering data points based on similarity.

- **K-nearest Neighbors**:
  Implemented K-nearest neighbors algorithm for classification and regression tasks, leveraging the concept of similarity among data points.

From scratch, I built these algorithms. It was a journey filled with learning, debugging, and occasional victories.

Looking back, it's a proud moment for me. What started as a remedy for boredom turned into a fascinating hobby project. It feels great to see something I created from scratch come to life, and it's definitely a boost for the ego!
